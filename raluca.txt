Hello world! This is Raluca :)

I come from Romania and I am born on 29th October 1987. 
I lived for 10 years in Bucharest where I also studied Sociology and Literature.
I worked in different companies, my last two jobs being Management Assistant and Traffic Manager.
I liked working in Online Marketing, but it was a bit too stressful and got to have no time outside my job.
In 2015 I moved to Germany and one year later got married.
I like to live in Germany and right now I am setting a new path to my career.
Working as a Web Developer has never been an option for me, but it seems I got the chance now.
Projects I would like to work on:
- my own website with a blog page and a shop for my handmade stuff
- a website for me as a web developer
- an app for learning a foreign language
